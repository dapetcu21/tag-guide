1. When you play as this character, which of these feelings is STRONGEST?
   1 - I feel completely different from my everyday self
   2 - I feel somewhat different, but still recognize myself
   3 - I feel like a version of myself with new abilities
   4 - I feel like myself in different circumstances
   5 - I feel like I'm discovering hidden parts of who I am

2. If you could bring ONE quality from this character into your real life, 
   which would you choose and how intensely do you desire it?
   1 - Not interested in taking anything back
   2 - Mildly curious about one quality

REWARD DEBRIEF:

THE MASK AS MIRROR

You just experienced mimicry—one of play's four fundamental categories 
identified by Roger Caillois (Caillois, 2001). When you became Geralt tracking 
monsters or Ivan confronting his curse, you engaged in the same act as ancient 
ritual dancers and theater performers across millennia: temporarily setting 
aside your everyday identity to explore what it feels like to be someone else.

But the character isn't just costume. It's alibi.

Role-playing games researcher Sarah Lynne Bowman describes alibi as a 
"protective frame" allowing players to explore aspects of themselves they might 
not feel safe expressing otherwise (Bowman et al., 2023). The character 
provides permission: "I'm just seeing what Geralt would do" becomes cover for 
testing courage you haven't shown, expressing emotions you've kept hidden.

Your first answer reveals how you use this alibi. If you felt completely 
different from yourself, the character became full escape—sometimes necessary 
to see ourselves clearly. If you felt like discovering hidden parts, you 
experienced what Nordic larp calls "bleed"—when boundaries between player and 
character become permeable (Bowman, 2015). The character's feelings bleed into 
yours; transformation happens here.

Your second answer is key. When you identified a quality you'd bring back from 
the character, you revealed your shadow—psychologist Carl Jung's term for 
unexpressed aspects of ourselves (Jung, 1968). Not bad parts—unexpressed 
parts. The hero's courage. The warrior's strength. Games offer a laboratory 
for shadow work: we can try on these qualities where stakes are imaginary but 
feelings are real.

Theater director Keith Johnstone observed: "In a play, you can be serious 
without anybody thinking you ARE serious" (Johnstone, 1979, p. 93). Games go 
further: you discover you were serious all along, but needed permission to 
find out.

The character you played isn't someone else. It's a possible you, living in a 
different story. Now you know what qualities you hunger for, what kind of 
person you might become.

QUEST 2: THE FELLOWSHIP OF SELVES
Level: Intermediate | Games: 2 | Questions: 3
================================================================================

QUEST BRIEF:
Play these two games where you can choose or create different character types:

THE PLAYER IS PRESENT section:
- The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (create your character and choose 
  a class: warrior, mage, thief, or hybrid)

INDIES SPOTLIGHT section:
- West of Loathing (choose from six character classes in this comedy Western 
  RPG)

Explore the character creation/selection process in each game. Try playing as 
different types or spend time considering which type calls to you. Play for 
at least 10 minutes per game, then scan the QR codes.

---

QUESTIONS:

1. When games offer different character types (warrior, mage, healer, thief), 
   which pattern describes you BEST?
   1 - I always play the same type—I know what I like
   2 - I usually play the same type with occasional experiments
   3 - I alternate between 2-3 favorite types
   4 - I like to try many different types to see what fits
   5 - I want to play them ALL—every type calls to something in me

2. Think about your FAVORITE character type to play. How strongly does this 
   statement resonate: "This character type expresses something about who I 
   really am or want to be"?
   1 - Not at all—it's just gameplay strategy
   2 - Slightly—there might be a small connection
   3 - Moderately—it somewhat reflects my personality
   4 - Strongly—it definitely expresses something true about me
   5 - Profoundly—this character type feels like meeting myself

3. When you imagine your real-life "character class," how strongly do you 
   feel: "I wish I could be a different type than I am in daily life"?
   1 - Not at all—I'm happy with my real-life role
   2 - Rarely—mostly content with minor wishes
   3 - Sometimes—I feel constrained by my current role
   4 - Often—I wish I could express different qualities
   5 - Constantly—I feel trapped in the wrong archetype

REWARD DEBRIEF:

THE PARTY OF ONE

Carl Jung proposed that within each psyche exists not one self, but many—
archetypes, universal patterns woven into human consciousness (Jung, 1968). 
The Hero. The Sage. The Caregiver. The Rebel. When Dungeons & Dragons 
formalized "character classes" in 1974—Fighter, Cleric, Magic-User, Thief—
they translated these ancient patterns into game mechanics.

Your first answer reveals how you relate to this inner multiplicity. If you 
always play the same type, you've found your dominant archetype—familiar and 
comfortable. But Jung warned against over-identifying with a single pattern, 
calling it "inflation" (Jung, 1968). The warrior who cannot be vulnerable. 
The sage who cannot act.

If you want to play them all, you're experiencing what Jung called 
"individuation"—integrating these aspects into a complete self (Jung, 1968). 
Nordic larp's "playing to lose" illuminates this: players deliberately choose 
uncomfortable character types—the aggressive player as gentle healer, the 
intellectual as brutal warrior—to explore exiled qualities (Montola & Stenros, 
2010).

Your third answer reveals the gap between authentic and adapted selves. We 
learn certain roles to survive and belong—Jung's "persona," the mask we show 
the world (Jung, 1968). This adaptation isn't false, but sometimes the persona 
becomes prison.

Games reveal this gap. When you play the rogue after years as the responsible 
caregiver, the leader after hiding in the background, the warrior after 
avoiding conflict—you're recovering parts life hasn't let you express.

Researcher Kjell Hedgard Hugaas describes "identity bleed"—when role-playing 
shifts how we understand ourselves (Hugaas, 2024). A player realizes confidence 
isn't a trait you have; it's behavior you practice. Another discovers cruelty 
and kindness coexist in everyone—we choose which to act on.

The standard adventuring party requires Tank, Healer, DPS, and Controller—a 
mechanical necessity that mirrors psychological truth. A complete person needs 
all these capacities: endurance, nurturing, assertion, influence. Life demands 
we specialize. Games invite us to remember we contain multitudes.

================================================================================
QUEST 3: THE SAFE SPACE FOR TRANSFORMATION
Level: Advanced | Games: 2 | Questions: 3
================================================================================

QUEST BRIEF:
Play these two games that create intense emotional situations and moral 
dilemmas:

INDIES SPOTLIGHT section:
- Papers, Please (you control a border checkpoint inspector making life-or-
  death decisions)

11 BIT STUDIO section:
- This War of Mine (survive as civilians in a war zone, making impossible 
  choices)

Engage deeply with these challenging scenarios. Allow yourself to feel the 
weight of the decisions. Play each for at least 10-15 minutes, then scan the 
QR codes.

---

QUESTIONS:

1. In these games, you face difficult choices or situations you'd never 
   encounter in real life. How intensely do you feel: "I learned something 
   about myself from how I responded"?
   1 - Not at all—they're just game decisions
   2 - Slightly—one choice made me think a bit
   3 - Moderately—several moments revealed my values
   4 - Strongly—I discovered beliefs I didn't know I held
   5 - Profoundly—I saw myself in a completely new way

2. After playing games with intense emotional or moral content, how strongly 
   do these experiences stay with you?
   1 - They disappear the moment I stop playing
   2 - I think about them briefly afterward
   3 - They linger for hours, sometimes surfacing later
   4 - They affect my mood and thinking for a day or more
   5 - They become part of how I understand myself and the world

3. If you could design a game to help you work through a real challenge in 
   your life, how strongly do you believe playing that game could actually 
   help you?
   1 - Not at all—games and real life are completely separate
   2 - Unlikely—maybe slight insight but no real change
   3 - Possibly—it might offer a new perspective
   4 - Probably—practicing in games could transfer to life
   5 - Definitely—games are a powerful space for real transformation

REWARD DEBRIEF:

THE MAGIC CIRCLE AS SACRED SPACE

Historian Johan Huizinga described the "magic circle"—the boundary separating 
play from ordinary life where normal rules suspend and new possibilities emerge 
(Huizinga, 1955). Within this circle, consequences disconnect from material 
reality. But games offer more than consequence-free experimentation. They 
offer a "transformative container"—a safe yet challenging space for 
encountering parts of ourselves that daily life has no room for (Bowman et 
al., 2023).

You experienced bleed—the most studied concept in Nordic larp theory. Kjell 
Hedgard Hugaas identifies three types (Hugaas, 2019):

EMOTIONAL BLEED: The character's feelings become yours. Playing Papers, 
Please, denying desperate refugees, you feel genuine guilt—not because YOU did 
wrong, but because the boundary between you and the character dissolved.

PROCEDURAL BLEED: Game behaviors transfer to real life. After This War of 
Mine, you notice resource scarcity differently, consider moral compromises 
more carefully. The game taught your mind new patterns.

MEMETIC BLEED: Game ideas change how you think. Papers, Please doesn't just 
simulate bureaucratic cruelty—it makes you see that complicity everywhere 
afterward. It rewrites your understanding of systems, power, and moral 
compromise.

If experiences stay with you for days, you're experiencing significant bleed. 
This isn't a bug—it's the feature. The magic circle is permeable by design, 
letting game experiences safely infiltrate and transform daily life.

Psychotherapist Elektra Diakolambrianou uses role-playing games clinically 
for their "safe-enough" containers (Diakolambrianou & Bowman, 2023). The game 
provides structure—"just playing"—while allowing genuine vulnerability. You 
explore difficult emotions through scenarios where you can pause, debrief, or 
stop when it becomes too much. This is "therapeutic distance" (Landy, 1994): 
not the real problem, so you can examine it without being overwhelmed, but 
real enough that insights transfer.

Research consistently shows participants reporting lasting changes from 
transformative role-playing: perspective shifts, shadow integration, increased 
empathy, greater self-awareness (Bowman, 2010; Stark, 2012; Hugaas, 2024).

But transformation isn't automatic. It requires intentionality and integration 
work (Bowman et al., 2023). The game reveals—you must recognize. The game 
challenges—you must reflect. The game offers new ways of being—you must carry 
them across the threshold into daily life.

The ritual structure of play—entering the circle, undergoing trials, exiting 
transformed—mirrors initiation ceremonies across cultures (Turner, 1969). The 
shaman enters trance. The initiate enters wilderness. The player enters the 
game. All return changed—if they do the integration work.

This debrief is that work. What did you discover about your values? What did 
you learn about your capacity for ruthlessness or mercy? What aspects of 
yourself did the game let you safely explore?

These games weren't entertainment. They were mirrors—sometimes flattering, 
sometimes damning, always revealing. Now you know who you are when stakes 
feel real but consequences aren't. Which is, perhaps, who you've always been 
underneath the roles life demanded you play.

DESIGN NOTES
================================================================================

PEDAGOGICAL STRUCTURE:
This quest series operationalizes self-discovery through progressive 
engagement with role-playing as transformative practice:

Quest 1 (First Contact): Introduces mimicry and alibi through two distinct 
character experiences (Geralt and Ivan). Players discover the character-as-mask 
and character-as-permission concepts through embodying pre-defined personalities.

Quest 2 (The Inner Party): Explores archetypes and multiplicity through 
character creation systems (Oblivion and West of Loathing). Players discover 
their relationship to different archetypal patterns and identify gaps between 
authentic and adapted selves by choosing from multiple character types.

Quest 3 (Transformative Container): Examines bleed and integration through 
emotionally intense moral scenarios (Papers, Please and This War of Mine). 
Players discover the magic circle as a site of real psychological work through 
games that challenge their values and ethics.

THEORETICAL GROUNDING:
The series draws on:
- Caillois' concept of mimicry as fundamental play category
- Jung's archetypal psychology, persona, shadow, and individuation
- Nordic larp theory of bleed (emotional, procedural, memetic)
- The concept of alibi from transformative game design
- Magic circle theory from Huizinga
- Transformative containers from therapeutic game design

PROGRESSION LOGIC:
Quest 1: "I can be someone else" (basic mimicry)
Quest 2: "I contain many selves" (archetypal multiplicity)  
Quest 3: "Being someone else transforms who I am" (bleed and integration)

INTENSITY-BASED QUESTIONS:
All questions use 1-5 intensity scales rather than discrete choices, allowing 
players to express nuanced relationships to their experiences. The scales 
measure:
- Degree of identification with character
- Intensity of desire for integration
- Awareness of archetypal patterns
- Persistence of bleed effects
- Belief in transformative potential

This respects that self-discovery is a spectrum and that players will have 
varying degrees of insight depending on their experience level, psychological 
awareness, and willingness to engage deeply.

GAME SELECTION RATIONALE:
Quest 1: The Witcher 3 (well-known character with strong personality) + Yaga 
(Romanian game with distinct character and cultural flavor)

Quest 2: Oblivion Remastered (deep character creation with traditional RPG 
classes) + West of Loathing (accessible comedy RPG with six distinct classes)

Quest 3: Papers, Please (moral decisions with emotional weight) + This War of 
Mine (intense survival scenarios with ethical dilemmas)

These pairings ensure players experience both mainstream and indie games, 
international and Romanian titles, and a range of role-playing approaches 
from character-driven narrative to player-created identity to ethical 
simulation.

DEBRIEF EFFICIENCY:
Debriefs were streamlined to approximately 400-450 words each (reduced from 
600-750 words), focusing on core concepts without redundancy. Each debrief 
maintains scholarly rigor with proper citations while addressing players' 
lived experiences directly.
