TAG gamification game-design documentAll play means something – Johan HuzningaAn exhibition about the art of games, their cultural value, and the sociological depth of play itself, is incomplete without play. Through it we evoke, exemplify, explain, and mythologize what is at once special, wonderful, and banal about mere games.PurposeAs game designers, we see the world through the lenses of our craft: rules and goals, feedback loops and magic circles, core mechanics and meta-structures, quests and rewards, rituals and play entwined. In an age of disenchantment, games re-enchant. They turn the everyday into spectacle, possibility, and play surface.By slightly lifting the veil, through words but mostly through interaction, we invite visitors to glimpse the colors of our goggles. And, most naturally, we invite them to join us in play.PillarsShow then tellThis exhibition leans on theory and history from game studies, design, HCI, psychology, sociology, and anthropology. But never as preface. Knowledge is unlocked as reward, an explanation revealed only after the experience, as the gist of what they just played.Ladder insightEach component builds on its neighbors, climbing a multi-axis ladder of understanding. Exhibits cross-reference one another, re-exemplify each other’s lessons, and embody the very points they seek to prove.Participate your wayGames invite and embody voluntary actions. Difficult or trivial, they lose their ludic ease when the choice to engage with them is anuled. Visitors can follow their own path through play.StructureThe exhibit will be structured in 16 different quests, structured on 2 axis, walking the player through 4 stages of 4 important insights related to games: 1. Play is language2. Play is learning3. Play is self-discovery4. Play is designThe first stage of each track begins simply: a one-step quest requiring minimal effort, leading to a first insight. Stages two and three demand more effort and deeper engagement. Stage four culminates in quests created by fellow players, designed as part of the “Play is Design” track. Play is languageInsight: The first track, about language, will explore the imensity of play, the many aspects of existence that are about play, through play, or colored by play, that exhibit a ludic undertone and a thematic resonence between them. Together they form the constelation of homo ludens’es reality. Core gameplay: Participants uncover and collect expressions and fragments of language scattered throughout the exhibition, that refer or feature elements from the lexical family of play, toys and games in a variety of indo-european languages.Play is learningInsight: Play teaches. Games scaffold learning, and learning sustains fun. This track explores how games serve as playful avenues into knowledge, and how discovery itself is the core of joy.Core gameplay: It will require participants to find, discern and deduce facts about the history and world of games and game development, and to answer correctly some quiz questions based on knowledge that can be found throughout the exhibition.Play is self-discoveryInsight: The third track, about self-discovery, explores the way in which the ludic attitude that games invite and the alibi they provide within their magic circle invite players to discover themselves. Within it, players discover themselves: what kinds of games they love, why they play, and how designers shape experiences for different kinds of players, whilst inviting self discovery and growth. Core gameplay: Participants scan QR codes tied to games they play. These trigger questions and reflections on taste, preference, and self.Play is makingInsight: This track reveals tools of the trade: feedback loops, goals, rewards, expressive play. Visitors analyze the games they have just played and the games of life itself. They learn to see design everywhereCore gameplay: Participants design new quests for all tracks, with specific restrictions or randomized prompts. They contribute content to the living body of the exhibition.UX * On entry, players scan a master QR code to open a webpage.* The webpage displays a 4?4 quest grid, each quest with its own icon.* Built-in QR scanning allows instant access to quest instructions.* Completing a quest, even incomplete, unlocks a text that explains what that quest was trying to evoke.The webpage provides a big button that opens up within it a QR code scanner. Whenever a QR code that is part of the game is scanned with it, it will open the required webpage or register the required input without any further click from the user. When a quest is scanned, its instructions are shown on the webpage. They all involve doing some actions, maybe scanning some more QR codes, then hitting submit. They can hit submit even without finishing the quest, but that will be logged. Once a quest is submitted, a piece of text explaining what the quest tried to exemplify and evoke is then shown. Types of input per trackLanguage: Players manually type expressions into a text field. Typos forgiven.Learning: they have to scan a QR code on a sheet of paper with their quiz. Each question to the quiz has answers A to E. Then in the app for each of them they have to select the correct choice from the dropdownSelf-discovery: they have to scan QR codes of games they played, displayed as a popup on screens after X minutes of gameplay. The QR codes are also found on info panels next to the games. Then they may have to answer through drop-downs to few questions on their screens.Design: they have to write down on a pre-structured sheet of paper the design of their little games. Each paper has pre-filled a particular QR code, which they scan. They then leave the sheet in a bin. After vetting them, they are placed for future players to pick-up, scan and complete and then leave into a “completed” bin.ContentTrack 1, Game 1
